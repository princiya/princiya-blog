This is the biggest key difference between integration and contract tests.</p>\n<p>For example:\nImagine you are planning to buy / rent a house. First you will see the house itself. If it interests you then you will sign the contract. The contract will then detail what is agreed between you and the other person selling / renting the place. This contract will then serve as the basis. If anything needs to change, then you need to update the contract itself.</p>\n<p>Replace the house with the application. You are the consumer, the owner of the house is the provider.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>First you will see the house itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You will build the application, run unit tests, and test the application locally.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If it interests you then you will sign the contract.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The contract tests are run with what is agreed between the consumer and the provider.</p>\n<p>You didn’t have to move into the house to sign the contract. But the contract was the first agreement before moving into the house.</p>\n<p>It’s the same with deploying the application itself to production or staging environment. The consumer contract tests can be tested against a mock provider.</p>\n<p>Whereas for the integration tests to be run, the application first needs to be deployed.</p>\n<p>Let me know what your thoughts are.</p>","timeToRead":3,"frontmatter":{"title":"Introduction to contract tests","date":"July 15, 2020","spoiler":"An introduction to contract tests and comparison with integration tests","cta":"testing"},"fields":{"slug":"/contract-tests-introduction/","langKey":"en"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/contract-tests-introduction/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/lessons-from-my-younger-self/","langKey":"en","directoryName":"lessons-from-my-younger-self","maybeAbsoluteLinks":[]},"frontmatter":{"title":"What would I advice my younger self"}},"next":null,"translations":[],"translatedLinks":[]}}}
