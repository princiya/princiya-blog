The latter was easier than the former.</li>\n<li>Having realised this, I asked everyone to think deep and reflect on the nature of the work, learning curve, product etc. to be able to figure out the difficult parts.</li>\n<li>The gist of this table is to ensure that nothing is really there on the <strong><em>dislike &#x26; bad</em></strong> column.</li>\n<li>If something is there then that should be the immediate action item to work on.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"consequences\"><a href=\"#consequences\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Consequences</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Once this activity was done, the next step was to align this table with the OKRs.</li>\n<li>The alternate way to look at this table is to look at the <strong>Good</strong> and the <strong>Bad</strong> columns from a company’s perspective.</li>\n<li>For example, if you mentioned something in the <strong>Bad</strong> column, you could look into this as <code class=\"language-text\">if this is really bad for the company</code>.</li>\n<li>So <strong>Good</strong> for you, might be <strong>Bad</strong> for the company or vice versa.</li>\n<li>Based on this, it gets quite easy to create objectives and key results for a quarter.</li>\n</ul>","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"title":"OKRs for a personal career path","tags":["leadership","mentorship"],"date":"July 11, 2020","spoiler":"Objectives and key results can help you achieve your career goals","cta":"OKR"},"fields":{"slug":"/okr/","langKey":"en"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/okr/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/dart/","langKey":"en","directoryName":"dart","maybeAbsoluteLinks":[]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Flutter","tags":["technical"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/lessons-from-my-younger-self/","langKey":"en","directoryName":"lessons-from-my-younger-self","maybeAbsoluteLinks":[]},"frontmatter":{"title":"What would I advice my younger self","tags":["leadership","advice","mentorship"]}},"translations":[],"translatedLinks":[]}}}
