If a slack message can be attended instantly, I do it so. It helps me take off the mental load about too many pending tasks for the day. Offcourse like I wrote earlier, priorities are important and have decided not to reply to interview applicants right away when the sprint was in a crucial phase. This instance was not about procrastination but rather realising what not to do for that time period.</p>\n<h3 id=\"being-productive-by-being-lazy\"><a href=\"#being-productive-by-being-lazy\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>being productive by being lazy</h3>\n<p>Sometimes I have productive weekends, sometimes lazy. Why are the lazy weekends not considered productive? It is just a thing to convince my brain. What matters in the end is really if I was happy or not. If my body wants to sleep the whole day, then why not? Why is it called lazy? If I like a particular Netflix episode and want to binge watch it, then why not? The only priority to keep in mind is not to stress the eyes or mind.</p>\n<p>I also apply the same principle at work. Not every day is a sunny day. Sometimes I don’t feel like working, but as long as I admit it and use to do something else, I am fine with it. Not acknowledging this fact and rather sitting  and staring at the monitor for mircales to happen and solve a problem will not serve the purpose. If you are my employer or colleague reading this, please don’t take me wrong. I do accept that I have this feeling, but I instead use to watch or read something interesting or even crack upon a blog idea.</p>\n<p>It’s a matter of time, and within an hour I would be refreshed enough to get back to work.</p>\n<p>This year has been fairly well for me 💪 ✌️. I have been promoted at <a href=\"../tags/leadership\">Curalie</a> as Head of Frontend Engineering and plus I now successfully balance my time with two jobs. My secondary (part-time) job is being a Developer coach with <a href=\"https://raise.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Raise</a>.</p>\n<p>People who know me personally do know that I am known to be doing multiple things at the same time. Over time I have come to realise that this is a skill which only few possess. Recently I was suprised when I <a href=\"../i-was-interim-cto\">discovered</a> that I could code while also listening and replying in between meetings.</p>\n<p><em>In this post, I will mainly focus on my primary job!</em></p>","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"title":"Procrastination or Elimination?","tags":["leadership","draft"],"date":"December 03, 2020","spoiler":"Learning to manage priorities by deciding what not to do and being productive.","cta":"Manage priorities"},"fields":{"slug":"/procrastination/","langKey":"en"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/procrastination/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn-what-not-to-do/","langKey":"en","directoryName":"learn-what-not-to-do","maybeAbsoluteLinks":[]},"frontmatter":{"title":"How I learned to manage my time as a new Manager","tags":["leadership","transition"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/graduation/","langKey":"en","directoryName":"graduation","maybeAbsoluteLinks":[]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Advice to my younger self - Part 2","tags":["mentorship","advice","q&a"]}},"translations":[],"translatedLinks":[]}}}
