What would you like to avoid? (Might include aspects like technologies you want to work with, industries you’re interested in, team dynamics, software development practices … whatever is important to you)</p>\n<p>I am looking for a technical leadership role with a focus on hands-on work. Although I am an empathetic people leader, I would prefer to have dedicated coaches focused on people management to take over this role while I get to focus more on technical and hands-on development and deployment efforts.\nI have started focusing more on the security side of things and currently learning ethical hacking, penetration testing, etc. and it would be nice if there is scope for me to learn and grow in this area.</p>\n<p>Optionally, describe a project that you worked on that you are proud of. It’s best if you can describe it from start to finish including the motivation and technical details. If you are describing a team effort, please be specific about your personal contribution.</p>\n<p>Recently, I was part of the team where we converted a single product offering to a platform. At Curalie GmbH, we had started out catering to hip and knee digital rehabilitation offerings and in April 2021 we launched a new platform that can support digital therapies and rehabilitation services to any chronic illness. It took us about 6 months time to launch the first version of the platform from start to finish.\nThis was my 4th successful product launch at this company and as the Head of Frontend I was responsible for the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Frontend architecture discussions. This was a real-time web and mobile application. We didn’t use the Redux-based store but used Freezer.js to enable reactive programming.</li>\n<li>built a custom charting library from scratch to visualize complex medical symptoms and patient monitoring data to support React and React Native. My prior experience working with D3.js and visualizations was very helpful here to fasten the development time. </li>\n<li>explaining technical concepts using mental models and metaphors to align stakeholders and various departments so that they could understand the platform better.</li>\n<li>setup of test automation both for web and mobile and supporting the manual QA team.</li>\n<li>infrastructure setup for mobile apps CI/CD from distributing apps internally to automated play and app store releases.</li>\n<li>timely pair programming and mentorship support to the team when in need.</li>\n<li>It did take lot of additional hours, since we also had to hire and onboard new people during this time. I am especially proud of this project because there was a lot of organisational chaos too which had to be sorted alongside implementing the technical solution. My special knack at managing and getting multiple things done, strong &#x26; open communication skills and good emphasis on documentation was appreciated by everyone.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finding the next job notes: <a href=\"https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/finding-next-level-job.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/finding-next-level-job.html</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Meaningful work + company</li>\n<li>Must be able to speak publically about the work and ideally blog.</li>\n<li>I want to be able to make things better. what is the scope and what is the first task that i would work in 1st 3 months. the company or team needs to have a plan with the new hire</li>\n<li>Must be a culture where you are allowed to take breaks, e.g. a lunch break, leaving on time. if extra hours then overtime.</li>\n<li>Not a person manager role, i.e. not head of development unless that is a technology leading role. I don’t mind managing people, but I don’t want that to be my entire job.</li>\n<li>possibility of advancement in the job role.</li>\n<li>Possibly a person who sits between the design, product, QA technology team; influencing all.</li>\n<li>I didn’t want to be the diversity hire.</li>\n<li>no Scrum master things</li>\n<li>no Product owner writing tickets</li>\n<li>i like compliance. documentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>questions to ask:\nHow are products/new features committed to?\nHow are tech decision made/sold?\nWhat does success look like in this role?\nWhat’s the biggest challenge facing the organisation?\nWhat are you hoping to improve/how is that measured?\nhow do product, design, tech, QA, devops talk?\nhow is the management? do they care for people?</p>\n<p>questions I will be asked:\nWhat are your main values, and how do they influence your work?\nWhat does good leadership look like?
